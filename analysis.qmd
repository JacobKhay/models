Public opinion and political preferences are often shaped by both personal characteristics and outside influences like media exposure. Using polling data from a recent national survey of U.S. adults, we examine whether being shown a pro-Trump advertisement affects support for Joe Biden.One potential weakness in our model is that the survey data may not fully represent the broader voting population, which could bias our estimates.

\[
\log\left( \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k
\]
